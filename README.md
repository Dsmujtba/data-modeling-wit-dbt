    23 ## ‚ú® Key Achievements & Skills Demonstrated
    24
    25 This project highlights my proficiency across the modern data stack:
    26
    27 *   **dbt Core Mastery & End-to-End Workflow:**
    28     *   Successfully configured and managed a dbt Core project from initial setup and source connection (AWS RDS PostgreSQL) through to model
       development, materialization, and comprehensive testing.
    29     *   Demonstrated a full dbt lifecycle including `dbt run` for model execution, `dbt test` for data validation, and `dbt deps` for package
       management.
    30 *   **Advanced Data Modeling Implementation:**
    31     *   **Star Schema Design:** Architected and built a robust Star Schema, including a `fact_orders` table (at the order line item granularity) and
       conforming dimension tables (`dim_customers`, `dim_employees`, `dim_offices`, `dim_products`, `dim_dates`).
    32     *   **Denormalized One Big Table (OBT):** Developed an optimized `orders_obt` by strategically pre-joining multiple source tables, catering to
       specific analytical use cases.
    33 *   **Sophisticated Transformation Logic with SQL & Jinja:**
    34     *   Authored modular and maintainable dbt models using advanced SQL combined with Jinja templating for dynamic queries, reusable logic (e.g.,
       macros, `ref`, `source` functions), and efficient development.
    35 *   **Rigorous Data Quality Assurance:**
    36     *   Implemented a comprehensive testing strategy by defining data quality tests in `schema.yml` files.
    37     *   Leveraged built-in dbt tests (`unique`, `not_null`, `accepted_values`, `relationships`) and `dbt-utils` macros (
       `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns`) to validate primary keys, foreign key relationships, column constraints, and business rules.
    38 *   **In-Database Transformation Orchestration:**
    39     *   Effectively utilized dbt to orchestrate all data transformations directly within the AWS RDS PostgreSQL database, leveraging its processing
       power and ensuring data remained within a secure cloud environment.
    40 *   **Cloud Data Warehousing on AWS:**
    41     *   Gained practical experience working with PostgreSQL on AWS RDS as a target data warehouse for dbt transformations.
    42 *   **Analysis of Modeling Trade-offs:**
    43     *   Developed a practical understanding of the structural differences, benefits, and drawbacks between Star Schema and OBT modeling approaches,
       enabling informed decisions for future projects.

    47 ## üìä Implemented Data Models
    48
    49 ### 1. Star Schema (`classicmodels_star_schema`)
    50
    51 Designed for optimal business intelligence and reporting performance, this dimensional model features:
    52
    53 *   **Central Fact Table:** `fact_orders` (capturing order line item details).
    54 *   **Conforming Dimensions:** `dim_customers`, `dim_employees`, `dim_offices`, `dim_products`, and `dim_dates`.
    55 *   **Key Techniques:** Employed dbt's `ref` function for inter-model dependencies, `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key` for robust primary keys in
       dimensions, and `dbt-date.get_date_dimension` for a comprehensive date dimension.
    56
    57 ### 2. One Big Table (OBT) (`classicmodels_obt`)
    58
    59 To cater to specific analytical queries that benefit from pre-joined data, I constructed the `orders_obt`.
    60
    61 *   **Denormalized Structure:** This table combines data from `orders`, `orderdetails`, `products`, `productlines`, `customers`, and `employees`.
    62 *   **Purpose:** Designed to simplify query writing for certain use cases and potentially improve performance by reducing complex joins at query
       time.
    63
    64 ---
    65
    66 ## ‚úÖ Data Quality & Testing: A Core Focus
    67
    68 Ensuring data reliability was paramount. I leveraged dbt's testing framework extensively:
    69
    70 *   **Schema Tests (`schema.yml`):** Defined tests directly alongside model schema definitions.
    71     *   **Uniqueness:** Validated primary keys in all dimension and fact tables (e.g., `customer_sk` in `dim_customers`).
    72     *   **Non-Null Constraints:** Ensured critical attributes (e.g., foreign keys in fact tables, key business identifiers) were always populated.
    73     *   **Referential Integrity:** Used `relationships` tests to confirm that foreign keys in fact tables correctly referenced primary keys in
       dimension tables.
    74 *   **Custom Logic (via `dbt_utils`):** Employed `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns` for composite key validation in the OBT.
    75 *   **Execution:** All tests were executed via `dbt test`, providing immediate feedback on data integrity after model runs.

    79 ## üöß Challenges & Learnings
    80
    81 *(**Note to Candidate:** This is where you shine! Replace these with your actual experiences.)*
    82
    83 *   **Challenge 1: Optimizing Complex Joins for Performance:** [Describe a specific challenge you faced with a complex SQL join or transformation
       that was impacting performance. Explain the steps you took to diagnose and optimize it (e.g., indexing, materialization strategy, refactoring SQL).]
    84 *   **Challenge 2: Managing dbt Environment & Credentials:** [Discuss any difficulties in securely managing database credentials for dbt in AWS RDS,
       or setting up the dbt environment. Explain your solution (e.g., using environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager, `profiles.yml` best practices).]
    85 *   **Learning: The Power of Incremental Models:** [Reflect on a specific learning, perhaps realizing the benefit of incremental models for large
       datasets, or the importance of modularity with `ref` and macros.]
    86 *   **Learning: Data Governance through Testing:** [Discuss how dbt's testing framework significantly improved your understanding of data quality and
       governance, and how it helps prevent regressions.]
